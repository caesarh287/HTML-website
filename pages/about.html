        <h2>Eminem's Childhood</h2>
        <p>Mathers was born on October 17, 1972, in St. Joseph, Missouri, the only child of Marshall Bruce Mathers Jr.
            and
            Deborah Rae "Debbie" (née Nelson). He is of English, Scottish, German, German Swiss, Polish and
            Luxembourgish ancestry. His mother nearly died during her 73-hour labor with him. Eminem's parents were in a
            band called Daddy Warbucks, playing in Ramada Inns along the Dakotas–Montana border before they separated.
            Eminem's
            father, Bruce Jr., left the family, moving to California after having two other children: Michael and Sarah.
            His
            mother, Debbie, later had a son named Nathan "Nate" Kane Samara. During his childhood, Eminem and his mother
            shuttled between Detroit and Missouri, rarely staying in one house for more than a year or two and living
            primarily with
            family members. In Missouri, they lived in several places, including St. Joseph, Savannah and Kansas City.
